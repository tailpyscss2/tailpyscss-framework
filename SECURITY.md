## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. Since TailPySCSS generates CSS files, the primary security concern is **Content Injection** via configuration files.

If you discover a vulnerability, please do NOT report it publicly.
Email the core team (or open a private GitHub advisory) describing:
1.  The vulnerability type (e.g., Code Injection in `tailpy.config.json`).
2.  Steps to reproduce.

We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours.
